# Research Notes: Early Ribbed Vaults - Durham vs. Saint-Denis

## Durham Cathedral (c. 1130)
- **Context:** Early Norman/Gothic transition period in England.
- **Key Feature:** Six-part ribbed vaults in the nave (c. 1130–1135). Often considered the first systematic use of ribbed vaults over a nave.
- **Structural Innovation:** The ribs (diagonal arches) are made of stone and are structurally integral to the vault, helping to carry the weight of the infill (webbing) and directing thrust onto reinforced piers.
- **Questions:**
  - What specific structural problem did the ribbed vault solve that the barrel or groin vault could not? (Possibility: groin vaults required massive walls for support, while ribs allowed for a more skeletal structure, enabling larger windows and higher ceilings.)
  - How did the use of pointed arches (if present) influence the vault's design? (Pointed arches reduce lateral thrust compared to semicircular arches, allowing for taller, more stable construction.)

## Basilica of Saint-Denis (c. 1140–1144)
- **Context:** Abbey church near Paris, under Abbot Suger; often cited as the birthplace of Gothic architecture.
- **Key Feature:** Ribbed vaults in the choir and ambulatory (c. 1140). Possibly earlier experiments with thin webbing and pointed ribs.
- **Structural Innovation:** The combination of ribbed vaults with pointed arches, large stained-glass windows, and flying buttresses (though buttresses may have been added later). This ensemble allowed for unprecedented height and light.
- **Questions:**
  - How did the ribbed vault at Saint-Denis differ from Durham's in terms of geometry and construction technique? (Were the ribs more refined? Was the webbing thinner?)
  - Did the builders at Saint-Denis consciously adopt ribs from Norman examples, or did they develop them independently?
  - What role did Abbot Suger's theological ideas (light as divine) play in pushing for architectural innovations that allowed more window space?

## Comparative Thoughts
- Durham's vaults are earlier but still relatively heavy and conservative (thick walls, small windows). Saint-Denis represents a more radical synthesis of features that would define the Gothic style.
- Both sites used ribs to create a stable framework, but Saint-Denis integrated them into a holistic system that emphasized verticality and luminosity.

## Research Tasks
- Review primary sources: Suger's writings (*De administratione*, *De consecratione*) for Saint-Denis; chronicles for Durham.
- Consult secondary sources: Jean Bony (*French Gothic Architecture of the 12th and 13th Centuries*), Robert Bork (*The Geometry of Rib Vaults*), and others.
- Determine precise dates and construction phases.
