**Innovation:** [A clear, concise description of the key innovation related to the ribbed vault, e.g., "First systematic use of ribbed vaults over a nave," "Introduction of the sexpartite (six-part) rib vault."]

**Technological Advancement:** [Explain the "how." What new technique or form was used? e.g., "Concentration of weight onto reinforced piers," "Use of pointed arches to direct thrust downwards."]

**Challenge & Solution:** [Describe the specific structural challenge builders faced (e.g., "height," "light," "roof weight") and how this specific vault design was the solution.]

### c. 1133 - Durham Cathedral, Durham

**Innovation:** First systematic use of ribbed vaults over a nave (sexpartite six‑part rib vault) in England, marking a decisive transition from Romanesque to Gothic building techniques.

**Technological Advancement:** Use of pointed transverse arches and diagonal stone ribs to create a rigid skeleton that carries the weight of the infill (webbing) and concentrates loads onto reinforced piers. The ribs act as permanent centering during construction and reduce the need for massive wall support.

**Challenge & Solution:** Builders needed to support heavy stone vaults over a wide nave while minimizing lateral thrust on the walls. The ribbed vault directed weight vertically downward, allowing for taller, more stable construction and the eventual introduction of larger clerestory windows. This innovation solved the problem of how to achieve greater height and light without compromising structural integrity.
